        <h1>Java Syntax</h1>
        <h2>Java Syntax</h2>
        <p>In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called <mark> Main.java</mark>, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:<br>
            <b>Main.java</b><br>
        <em> public class Main { <br>
            public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
              System.out.println("Hello World");<br>
            }<br>
        }</em>
        </p>
        <h3>Example explained</h3>
        <p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a <mark>class</mark>. In our example, we named the class <Strong>Main</Strong>.
            A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.<br>
            <br>
           <b> Note: </b>Java is case-sensitive: <i>"MyClass"</i> and <i>"myclass"</i> has different meaning.<br>
            <br>
            The name of the java file <b>must match</b> the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add <kbd>".java"</kbd> to the end of the filename. 
            To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the <u>Get Started Chapter</u> for how to install Java. The output should be:</p>
            <mark>Hello World</mark><br>

            <h2>The main Method</h2>
            <p>
                The <mark>main()</mark> method is required and you will see it in every Java program:<br>
                <br>
                <em>public static void main(String[] args)</em><br>
                <br>
                Any code inside the <mark> main()</mark> method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.
                For now, just remember that every Java program has a <mark>class</mark> name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the<mark> main() </mark> method.
